# Git & GitHub Project Workflow Demonstration

## Project Purpose
This project demonstrates mastery of Git and GitHub by completing a full software project workflow individually from repository creation to release management while following proper version control practices.

The goal is to show how to:
- Create and set up a GitHub repository
- Manage branches and commits effectively
- Use .gitignore and licensing correctly
- Collaborate with Git best practices

## Project Overview
This repository serves as an exercise for practicing end-to-end software development workflow using Git and GitHub.
It includes:
- A properly initialized repository with README, .gitignore, and LICENSE
- Structured commits with meaningful messages
- Example branches for new features
- Pull requests
## Known Issues / Future Improvements

- Right now, the .gitignore only covers the basics, I’d like to expand it to include .env files, build folders, and OS-specific files so the repo stays clean.
- The CONTRIBUTING.md file is very simple, I’d add coding style rules, branch naming tips, and setup steps if more people were contributing.
- This repo doesn’t have example project files yet. Adding a small sample project would make the workflow easier to follow.
- Some screenshots or diagrams of branches, issues, and pull requests would make the documentation more visual and beginner-friendly.
- In the future, I could add a basic test script or CI/CD workflow to show automated checks before merging code.

## Project Management

This project uses a **GitHub Project Board** to organize and track work.  
Issues are actively categorized across different columns:  
- **To Do** – tasks planned but not yet started  
- **In Progress** – tasks currently being worked on  
- **Done** – completed tasks  

This board provides a clear overview of the project's current status and helps keep work structured.
