# Docker Introduction
## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to build, package, and run applications in containers. 
Containers are lightweight, portable environments that include everything an application needs to run; so it works the same way in any system

## Why Docker is Useful in DevOps
- **Consistency:** Eliminates the "works on my machine" issue.
- **Portability:** Containers run on any system with Docker installed.
- **Speed:** Containers start quickly, speeding up development and testing.
- **Efficiency:** Uses fewer resources compared to virtual machines.
- **Automation:** Easily integrates into CI/CD pipelines for faster delivery.
- **Scalability:** Works with tools like Kubernetes to scale applications easily.
