## Why We Use YAML
We use YAML because it’s simple and easy to read, almost like writing plain English. Instead of dealing with a lot of brackets or complicated syntax, YAML lets us focus on the settings themselves.
In DevOps, YAML is everywhere. Having one common, human-readable format makes it easier for teams to share and maintain configurations. The best part is that YAML works across different platforms and programming languages, so it’s easy to keep everything consistent.
